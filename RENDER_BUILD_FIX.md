# üîß Render Build Fix - Pydantic/Rust Issue

## Problem Fixed

The build was failing with:
```
error: failed to create directory `/usr/local/cargo/registry/cache/...`
Read-only file system (os error 30)
```

This happens because old versions of `pydantic-core` require Rust compilation, which fails on Render's build system.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

Updated `requirements.txt` to use **newer versions with pre-built wheels**:

### Before (Failed):
```
pydantic==2.5.0
pydantic-core==2.14.1  # ‚ùå Requires Rust compilation
```

### After (Works):
```
pydantic==2.9.2
pydantic-core==2.23.4  # ‚úÖ Has pre-built wheels
```

## Changes Made

1. **Updated requirements.txt**
   - Newer pydantic versions (2.9.2)
   - All packages have pre-built wheels
   - Removed unnecessary dependencies
   - Optimized for Render deployment

2. **Updated render.yaml**
   - Added `PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1` to save memory
   - Added `pip install --upgrade pip` to build command
   - Set `plan: free` explicitly

3. **Updated build.sh**
   - Added `set -e` to exit on errors
   - Added `--no-cache-dir` flag
   - Better error messages

## What This Fixes

‚úÖ **No more Rust compilation errors**
‚úÖ **Faster builds** (pre-built wheels)
‚úÖ **Less memory usage**
‚úÖ **More reliable deployment**

## Test Locally (Optional)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv test_venv
source test_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Should install without any compilation!

## Deploy Again

Your next deploy on Render should work! üöÄ

The build will:
1. Install Python 3.11
2. Upgrade pip
3. Install all dependencies (2-5 minutes)
4. Download FinBERT model (5-10 minutes first time)
5. Start the server

**Total time: ~10-15 minutes**

## If Build Still Fails

Check these:
- [ ] Python version is 3.11 (not 3.13)
- [ ] `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.0` in environment variables
- [ ] Render is using `requirements.txt` from backend folder
- [ ] No custom build command overriding `build.sh`

## Need Help?

Check Render logs for specific error messages:
- Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Logs tab
- Look for the first error (usually near the bottom)

**Updated**: October 2025  
**Deploy Time**: 10-15 minutes
